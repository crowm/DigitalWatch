				DigitalWatch is a free open source project for watching DVB-T digital
				television. I started this project because I was unhappy with all the
				other applcations that were available at the time. They all lacked in
				their ability to customize many aspects of the tv watching experience,
				so i created DigitalWatch<br>
				<br>
				DigitalWatch is mostly oriented towards watching rather than recording
				although some versions do have recording capabilities. If you are intereted
				in scheduling your recordings then use
				<a href="http://dvb-ws.sourceforge.net/">DVB Web Scheduler</a>.<br>
				<br>
				DigitalWatch is not aimed at the extreme novice user. Maybe it will be
				in the future, but for now i'm not going out of my way to make it easy
				for anyone who doesn't like to tinker. That said, if you have any
				questions then ask on the
				<a href="http://forums.dvbowners.com/index.php">DVB Owners Forum</a>
				and someone will probabaly help you out.<br>

			    DigitalWatch 2 is still in development so not all the features from
			    the 0.xxx versions of DigitalWatch have been implemented yet.<br>

				DigitalWatch 2.x has been totally redeveloped from the DigitalWatch 0.x series with
				an entirely different architecture. As a result, not all of the features available
				in 0.x versions have been implemented in 2.x versions. I plan to add most of them
				back in as time permits but for the moment i'm focussing on the big things like
				channel scanning and the epg.<br>
				<br>
				<h4>What does it do?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Nice and simple interface, just the video window, and all information comes up as an On Screen Display. No pesky right click menu.<br>
					<li>OSD items are configurable (font, colour, location on screen, size)<br>
					<li>Operational from the keyboard to make using a remote easy.<br>
					<li>Configurable key assignments.<br>
						The default key assignments are VisionPlus remote friendly.<br>
					<li>Single key channel selection. Channels are organised by network rather than having a great long list of duplicate channels.<br>
					<li>Fast channel changing.<br>
					<li>Choose which video and audio decoders get used and access filter properties dialogs.<br>
					<li>Volume control that doesn't tamper with the windows mixer.<br>
					<li>Some of the Options
					<ul>
						<li>Always On Top<br>
						<li>Disable Screensaver<br>
						<li>Zoom (For watching 4:3 material without the black border)
					</ul>
					<li>Supports HD and AC3, but depends on which video and audio decoders you choose and what their settings are.<br>
					<li>SPDIF passthrough depending on Audio decoder, Audio decoder settings, and hardware.<br>
					<br>
					New since 0.xxx versions<br>
					<li>Supports any BDA compatible DVB-T digital tv tuner.<br>
					<li>Supports multiple tuners<br>
					<li>Tuners are automatically detected. No configuration required unless you want to disable one<br>
					<li>Much nicer OSD (only works for the Overlay Mixer at the moment. VMR9 is to come)<br>
					<li>Detailed logging to diagnose problems<br>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h4>What doesn't it do? (Yet)</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Channel scanning.<br>
					<li>Time Shifting (for VisionPlus cards with WDM drivers only at the moment)<br>
					<li>Now and Next information displayed on OSD<br>
					<li>Play back recorded files.<br>
					<li>Start on last channel (like a normal tv)<br>
					<li>Start in fullscreen<br>
					<li>Set Aspect Ratio<br>
				</ul>

				<h4><a name="DW2005">DigitalWatch 2.0.0.5</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Changed card detection so that newly added and removed cards get automatically actived and deactivated.<br>
						<li>Changed DVB-T source rendering so that the pin types are done in order<br>
						<ul>
							<li>teletext is only done if video renders ok.<br>
							<li>ac3 is only rendered if mp2 doesn't render ok. (there'll be a preference for this in the future)<br>
						</ul><li>Added lots of decoders (thanks to bear for doing most of the work)<br>
						<li>Fixed resolution problem is only the primary directdraw device is found.<br>
						<li>Added code to switch OSD render method depending on the video renderer being used.<br>
							This means that the VMR7 and VMR9 can now be used without flickering, but there's no OSD while using them.<br>
						<li>Added extra logging for enumerations of directdraw devices and pin creation and rendering.<br>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h4><a name="DW2003">DigitalWatch 2.0.0.3</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					I've modified the directdraw enumeration a bit so it should work. If it doesn't
					then it will at least give more details in the log that i can use.<br>
					<br>
					The only file changed in the zip from 2.0.0.1 is DigitalWatch.exe<br>

				<h4><a name="DW2001">DigitalWatch 2.0.0.1</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Lots of stuff still isn't implemented so don't expect too much.<br>
					<br>
					To get up and running:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Unless you're using Mt. Dandenong in Melbourne then you'll have to edit
							the BDA_DVB-T\Channels.xml file. Once i get scanning done editing this
							file shouldn't be necessary anymore.<br>
							The stream types are 0 unknown, 1 video, 2 mpeg audio, 3 ac3 audio, 4 teletext.<br>
							<a href="http://mediapix-australia.com/htpc/Channels.zip">Brisbane Channels</a>
							thanks to bear.<br>
						<li>Currently it's set up to use the GPL MPEG-1/2 video decoder and the
							DNTV Live! Audio decoder. If you don't have these installed then you'll
							need to either install them, or<br>
							Use an existing, or add a new, decoder entry in the Decoders.xml file
							and edit the MediaTypes.xml file to use that different decoder.<br>
							I think you should be able to figure out once you see the files.<br>
							Only the Overlay Mixer video renderer works properly at the moment.<br>
						<li>Enter, Esc, and the arrow keys are your friends. See the Keys.xml files
							(there's one in the BDA_DVB-T folder too) to know what other keys are
							available. Most of the things i've implemented use the same key as
							previous DW's, like 0-9 for network selection,
							[ and ] for 100% and 133% zoom etc...<br>
						<li>The FPS reading at the bottom is the rate which the directdraw overlay
							is drawing. It has nothing to do with the fps of the video stream.<br>
						<li>I added 10 example items to the main menu just to show off the fancy
							scrolling menu<br>
						<li>If it's not working look in the DigitalWatch.log file<br>
						<li>If you have more than 1 tuner, then each time you change channels the
							next card will be used. If you have trouble with a particular card then
							you can disable it in BDA_DVB-T\Cards.xml<br>
					</ul>
