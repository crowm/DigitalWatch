				DigitalWatch is a free open source project for watching and recording DVB-T digital
				television. I started this project because I was unhappy with all the
				other applcations that were available at the time. They all lacked in
				their ability to customize many aspects of the tv watching experience,
				so i created the DigitalWatch 0.x series which was designed around the
				WinDTV SDK and ended up having BDA support tacked on the side in the 0.7x versions.<br>
				It became obvious that the design I'd used to create the original version of
				DigitalWatch did not suit BDA, so I undertook a total redesign of the DigitalWatch
				archtecture which has resulted in DigitalWatch 2.x<br>
				<br>
				DigitalWatch is mostly oriented towards watching rather than recording
				although most versions do have recording capabilities. If you are intereted
				in scheduling your recordings then I recommend using
				<a href="http://dvb-ws.sourceforge.net/">DVB Web Scheduler</a>.<br>
				<br>
				DigitalWatch is not aimed at the extreme novice user. Maybe it will be
				in the future, but for now i'm not going out of my way to make it easy
				for anyone who doesn't like to tinker. That said, if you have any
				questions then ask on the
				<a href="http://forums.dvbowners.com/index.php">DVB Owners Forum</a>
				and someone will probabaly help you out.<br>
				<br>
			    DigitalWatch 2 is still in development so not all the features from
			    the 0.xxx versions of DigitalWatch have been implemented yet.<br>

			<div id=text>
				DigitalWatch 2.x has been totally redeveloped from the DigitalWatch 0.x series with
				an entirely different architecture. As a result, not all of the features available
				in 0.x versions have been implemented in 2.x versions. It's planned to add most of them
				as time permits but time doesn't permit very much for me these days. Fortunately bear
				and DigiWatchSaver have been able to chip in and start adding support for recording
				and timeshifting.<br>
				<br>
				<h4>What does it do?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Nice and simple interface, just the video window, and all information comes up as an On Screen Display. No pesky right click menu.<br>
					<li>OSD items are configurable (font, colour, location on screen, size)<br>
					<li>Operational from the keyboard to make using a remote easy.<br>
					<li>Configurable key assignments.<br>
					<li>Single key channel selection. Channels are organised by network rather than having a great long list of duplicate channels.<br>
					<li>Fast channel changing.<br>
					<li>Choose which video and audio decoders get used for each media type.<br>
					<li>Volume control that doesn't tamper with the windows mixer.<br>
					<li>Always On Top option<br>
					<li>Disable Screensaver<br>
					<li>Zoom (For watching 4:3 material without the black border)
					<li>Supports HD and AC3. Of course this depends on which video and audio decoders you choose and what their settings are.<br>
					<br>
					<h5>New to 2.x versions</h5>
					<li>Supports any BDA compatible DVB-T digital tv tuner.<br>
					<li>Supports multiple tuners (Not simultaneously. Yet)<br>
					<li>Tuners are automatically detected. No configuration required unless you want to disable one<br>
					<li>Much nicer OSD (only works for the Overlay Mixer at the moment. VMR9 is to come)<br>
					<li>Detailed logging to diagnose problems<br>
					<li>Channel scanning.<br>
					<br>
					<h5>Coming soon</h5>
					These are currently in the trunk source but are still undergoing bug fixes.
					<li>File Playback (using TSFileSource)<br>
					<li>Recording to multiple formats<br>
					<li>Timeshifting<br>
					<li>Command line arguments.<br>
					<li>Detection of Aspect Ratio, and the ability to override it.<br>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h4>What doesn't it do?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>See the <a href="http://nate.deepcreek.org.au/svn/DigitalWatch/trunk/docs/TODO.txt">TODO List</a><br>

				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Implemented Settings.xml, including:
						<ul>
							<li>All six application priorities. Low, BelowNormal, Normal, AboveNormal,
								High, and Realtime. AboveNormal is now the Default.
							<li>Window settings to remember Fullscreen, AlwaysOnTop, the Size, and the
								Position of the window when you close it and restore them when the app
								is next loaded.
							<li>Startup volume and mute setting.
							<li>Startup zoom, zoomMode, and overlay color controls settings.
						</ul><li>Fixed a crash caused when the window spans 2 screens by 1 pixel.
						<li>Added memory leak detection code from codeproject<br>
    						<a href=http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/MemLeakDetect.asp>http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/MemLeakDetect.asp</a>.
						<li>Added an append mode to the FileWriter class. ofstream caused problems
    						with the memory leak detection code so i'm using FileWriter everywhere
							now instead.
						<li>Fixed menu not hiding after changing channels.
						<li>Fixed channel reorder not saving the channels file.
						<li>Lots of memory leaks removed.
						<li>Added critical sections for most vectors to improved multithreading safety.
						<li>Improved OSD efficiency when displaying long lists.

				<h4><a name="DW-2.0.0.11">DigitalWatch 2.0.0.11</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Made ExecuteCommand operations able to read hex strings aswell as normal strings.
						<li>Fixed problem of Frequency list and Cards list duplicating if Watch TV is reselected
						<li>Fixed problem when scanning different frequencies with the same tsid

				<h4><a name="DW-2.0.0.9">DigitalWatch 2.0.0.9</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed channels file for when more than one broadcaster used the same transport stream id.
						<li>Fixed problem where selecting Watch TV a second time would duplicate all the channels.
						<li>Fixed problem in scanning. The waiting filters weren't cleared if there was a timeout scanning a table.
						<li>Fixed threading issue with data items and lists.
						<li>Fixed memory leak in OSD code

				<h4><a name="DW-2.0.0.7">DigitalWatch 2.0.0.7</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Note: This version updates the channels.xml file so if you want to keep your old one make sure you make a copy of it.<br>
					For this version i'd like people to start without a channels file at all to test out the scanning.<br>

					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Implemented Channel Scanning. This required heaps of other changes.<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Renamed "Program" in DVBTChannels to "Service".<br>
							<li>Added a command queue thread to TVControl to allow UpdateChannel events to be handled.<br>
							    This also allows the OSD to be drawn while changing channels.<br>
							<li>Reworked BDADVBTSource to be able to tune to frequencies without channels entries so that scanning can be done for that frequency.<br>
						</ul><li>Removed all state information (such as current network) from DVBTChannels. It's the wrong place for it.<br>
						<li>Added menu options for adding and ordering networks.<br>
						<li>Added FrequencyList to show a list of frequencies (for Australia) when adding networks.<br>
						<li>Added ability for an OSDList to contain both items and itemLists.<br>
						<li>Fixed DirectDraw OSD so the overlay color blt rectangle doesn't go out of bounds.<br>
						<li>Commented out the FPS display.<br>
						<li>Added DScaler video decoder.<br>
						<li>Fixed an exception when application is closing. There may still be a problem though.<br>
						<li>Fixed stuttering by setting the reference clock to the DW demux instead of the default demux.<br>
					</ul>

				<h4><a name="DW-2.0.0.5">DigitalWatch 2.0.0.5</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Changed card detection so that newly added and removed cards get automatically actived and deactivated.<br>
						<li>Changed DVB-T source rendering so that the pin types are done in order<br>
						<ul>
							<li>teletext is only done if video renders ok.<br>
							<li>ac3 is only rendered if mp2 doesn't render ok. (there'll be a preference for this in the future)<br>
						</ul><li>Added lots of decoders (thanks to bear for doing most of the work)<br>
						<li>Fixed resolution problem is only the primary directdraw device is found.<br>
						<li>Added code to switch OSD render method depending on the video renderer being used.<br>
							This means that the VMR7 and VMR9 can now be used without flickering, but there's no OSD while using them.<br>
						<li>Added extra logging for enumerations of directdraw devices and pin creation and rendering.<br>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		
			<div id=text>
				<h4><a name="DW-2.0.0.3">DigitalWatch 2.0.0.3</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					I've modified the directdraw enumeration a bit so it should work. If it doesn't
					then it will at least give more details in the log that i can use.<br>
					<br>
					The only file changed in the zip from 2.0.0.1 is DigitalWatch.exe<br>
				</div>
			</div>
		
			<div id=text>
				<h4><a name="DW-2.0.0.1">DigitalWatch 2.0.0.1</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Lots of stuff still isn't implemented so don't expect too much.<br>
					<br>
					To get up and running:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Unless you're using Mt. Dandenong in Melbourne then you'll have to edit
							the BDA_DVB-T\Channels.xml file. Once i get scanning done editing this
							file shouldn't be necessary anymore.<br>
							The stream types are 0 unknown, 1 video, 2 mpeg audio, 3 ac3 audio, 4 teletext.<br>
							<a href="http://mediapix-australia.com/htpc/Channels.zip">Brisbane Channels</a>
							thanks to bear.<br>
						<li>Currently it's set up to use the GPL MPEG-1/2 video decoder and the
							DNTV Live! Audio decoder. If you don't have these installed then you'll
							need to either install them, or<br>
							Use an existing, or add a new, decoder entry in the Decoders.xml file
							and edit the MediaTypes.xml file to use that different decoder.<br>
							I think you should be able to figure out once you see the files.<br>
							Only the Overlay Mixer video renderer works properly at the moment.<br>
						<li>Enter, Esc, and the arrow keys are your friends. See the Keys.xml files
							(there's one in the BDA_DVB-T folder too) to know what other keys are
							available. Most of the things i've implemented use the same key as
							previous DW's, like 0-9 for network selection,
							[ and ] for 100% and 133% zoom etc...<br>
						<li>The FPS reading at the bottom is the rate which the directdraw overlay
							is drawing. It has nothing to do with the fps of the video stream.<br>
						<li>I added 10 example items to the main menu just to show off the fancy
							scrolling menu<br>
						<li>If it's not working look in the DigitalWatch.log file<br>
						<li>If you have more than 1 tuner, then each time you change channels the
							next card will be used. If you have trouble with a particular card then
							you can disable it in BDA_DVB-T\Cards.xml<br>
					</ul>
