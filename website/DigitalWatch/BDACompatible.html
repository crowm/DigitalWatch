				After DigitalWatch 0.701 I added expermental support for BDA cards
				to DigitalWatch. After doing this I decided that to implement all
				the existing features of DigitalWatch with BDA i needed to
				redevelop DigitalWatch from scratch with a different architecture.
				Since the BDA version of DigitalWatch was missing a few features
				available in the standard DigitalWatch i decided not to release it
				officially.<br>
				<br>
				This page lists the different versions and what has been
				implemented in them.<br>
				<br>
				Martin S has continued on the work by adding support for<br>
				- Now & Next (EPG)<br>
				- Smooth Font Rendering<br>
				- DVR-MS Recording<br>
				- Many more BDA compatible cards<br>

					<br>
					Added a DVICO DVBInput mode.<br>
					<br>
					To use with the spectrums THDTV drivers set DVBInput=5 in settings.ini<br>
					To use with the DVICO BDA drivers set DVBInput=6 in settings.ini<br>
					<br>
					Now and Next, and Timeshifting are not implemented.<br>
					<br>
					TS Mux Recording is implemented, but in the limited testing i did the
					resulting file was often corrupt. I use WS for all my recordings so i'm
					not spending any more time on recording in this version of DW.<br>
					<br>
					In both DVBInput 5 and 6 modules i've re-enabled the reading of signal
					quality and strength. It seems to be working for the VP, but I'm not
					sure what it does for the DVICO.<br>
					<br>
					This exe should still work with the twinhan drivers in
					DVBInput 1, 2, and 4 modes, but i havn't tested it.<br>
					<br>
					For those with a DVICO that have never used DW before you'll need to
					create yourself a channels.ini file. The scanchannels.exe program that
					comes with DW0.701 will not work with the DVICO card so you'll have to
					do it manually. There's information about the file format in the docs,
					and there are a few threads on here where people have posted example
					channels.ini files.<br>

					<br>
					Just an update that will work with the new names in spectrum's new 1.5.0.0 BDA drivers.<br>
					I make no guarantees that anything will work properly, I'm half way
					through fixing a few things. Recording won't work, and i havn't re-enabled
					signal stats yet. The only testing i've done is that i checked that sd channels played.<br>

					<br>
					As before this zip file only contains a new DigitalWatch.exe file<br>
					To install just replace the DigitalWatch.exe from 0.701 and set DVBInput=5 in settings.ini<br>
					<br>
					Not implemented yet:<br>
					- Now and Next<br>
					- Timeshifting<br>
					<br>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Disabled the signal strength and quality polling. This is only temporary until spectrum resolves any driver issues in this area.<br>
						<li>Implemented recording for BDA. It relies on the Cyblerlink MPEG Muxer (mpgmux.ax) so you have to have it registered for it to work.<br>
						<li>Added the ability to pause the recording. (more details in post)<br>
						<li>Added LoadAudioRenderer function for AudioDecoders.ini (more details in post)<br>
					</ul>
