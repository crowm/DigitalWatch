			<div id=text>
				DigitalWatch is a free open source DTV watching and recording program
				to for the VisionPlus DVB-T. There are other options available, such as
				WinDTV/VisionDTV and Digibox/DigiVision, but I was unhappy with the lack
				of ability to customize many aspects of the tv watching experience, so i
				created DigitalWatch<br>
				<br>
				DigitalWatch is mostly oriented towards watching rather than recording
				although it does have recording capabilities. If you are more intereted
				in scheduling your recordings then try
				<a href="http://dvb-ws.sourceforge.net/">DVB Web Scheduler</a>.<br>
				<br>
				DigitalWatch is not aimed at the extreme novice user. Maybe it will be in the future,
				but for now i'm not going out of my way to make it easy for anyone who
				doesn't like to tinker. That said, if you have any questions then ask on the
				<a href="http://forums.dvbowners.com/index.php">DVB Owners Forum</a>
				and someone will probabaly help you out.<br>
				<br>
				This version of DigitalWatch is only for the VisionPlus DVB-T tuner with
				WDM drivers install. If you wish to use a tuner with BDA drivers then try
				the
				<a href="BDACompatible.html">BDA Compatible</a> version of DigitalWatch.<br>

			<div id=text>
				<h4><a name="DW0701">DigitalWatch 0.701</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed default ControlBar.ini to have ShowNowAndNext instead of ShowNaN<br>
						<li>Fixed broken functions in channels.ini<br>
						<li>Fixed NaNTime[n], NaNLength[n], and NaNDescription[n] for OSD.ini<br>
						<li>Added value parsing to DrawBitmap string.<br>
		      				eg. DrawBitmap("images\network$(NetworkNumber).bmp", ...)<br>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		
			<div id=text>
				<h4><a name="DW070">DigitalWatch 0.70</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
		  				<li>Fixed disabled SetColorControls<br>
		  				<li>Fixed GDI leak in EraseBackground<br>
		  				<li>Fixed OSD.ini to read from, and Settings.ini to write to, the app folder.<br>
		  				<li>Fixed ScanChannels.exe to start with Network_1 instead of Network_0<br>
		  				<li>Fixed "could not set IVideoWindow visible" when not using overlay mixer.<br>
						<li>Fixed crash when using VMR9. It works, but there's really bad OSD flicker.<br>
		  				<li>Fixed crash when using FFDShow and changing channels.<br>
		  				<li>Fixed timeshifting files not getting deleted on program exit.<br>
		  				<li>Totally reworked the OSD for better skinning support.<br>
		  				<ul>
		    				<li>All commands now trigger osd events which can be configured to show any
			  					of the available information.<br>
		    				<li>OSD text background can be transparent when not using the overlay mixer.<br>
		    				<li>Added bitmap support.<br>
		    				<li>Impoved on problem of OSD blanking out when any entry disapears.<br>
			  					It still happens occasionally but i think it's better than it was.<br>
							<li>Custom OSD events can be defined. Then assign the event to a key or
			  					button by using the event name instead of a predefined function.
			  					ShowTime, ShowChannelInfo (used to be ShowPids), ShowSignal, and
			  					ShowNowAndNext are no longer predefined functions. They are now events,
			  					so take a look at them for an example of what you can do.<br>
			  			</ul>
					  	<li>Added a control bar similar to zoomplayer's for easier mouse control.<br>
					    	See ControlBar.ini to configure or skin it.<br>
					      	Thanks to Builty for kicking this one off, and for the artwork.<br>
					  	<li>Added config options for mouse buttons and scroll wheel in keys.ini.<br>
					    	Thanks to Builty for this one.<br>
					  	<li>Added options for timeshifting location and duration to settings.ini.<br>
					      	Thanks to Joey for posting the code to do this.<br>
					  	<li>Added creation of the timeshifting profile file to the timeshift folder.<br>
					    	If you load this file with the StreamBufferSource from another computer you
					    	should be able to watch whatever is in the buffer. Untested.<br>
					</ul>
		  			Notes:<br>
		  			<ul>
			  			<li>I havn't done a lot of testing with all the changes i made to the way the
		    				OSD works so I wouldn't be surprised if there's a few bugs. Hopefully none
							are too serious.<br>
		  				<li>I've temporarily disabled the code that get's the signal quality and
		    				strength because it was causing some strange behaviour.<br>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		
			<div id=text>
				<h4><a name="DW0601">DigitalWatch 0.601</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
		  				<li>Fixed timeshifting requiring D drive bug.<br>
						<li>Added warning if no entries in channels.ini<br>
		  				<li>Fixed some of the project settings in the source.<br>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		
			<div id=text>
				<h4><a name="DW060">DigitalWatch 0.60</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>DigitalWatch is now open source.<br>
		  				<li>Fixed bug where if a decoder entry was used in channels.ini then it wouldn't reset properly for the next channel.<br>
		  				<li>Fixed current decoder text in OSD not updating on channel change.<br>
		  				<li>Now and Next Information Added (thanks RAvenGEr).<br>
		    				Requires a valid program number in channels.ini entries.<br>
		  				<li>ScanChannels.exe<br>
							Rather than trying to keep up-to-date channels.ini files for each city,
							especially now that program numbers have to be valid, you can use this
							command-line application to generate channel.ini entries.
							listing for you.<br>
		  				<li>Revamped OSD.<br>
		  					Shouldn't look any different to the end user, but the back
							end has been overhauled to provide support for multi-line entries. If
							OSD.ini entries have the maxWidth set to anything greater than 0 then
							text will wrap to the next line if it reaches that width.<br>
							I did my best to eliminate flicker, but there's sometimes a slight flick
							everytime an entry changes.<br>
		   				<li>Signal Strength and Quality (thanks RAvenGEr)<br>
		  				<li>DVBInput mode 4 - Same as 2 but with timeshifting.<br>
							It's using the Microsoft Stream Buffer Sink and Stream Buffer Source
							filters. According to the documentation these only work in windows XP.<br>
		  					No configuration for timeshifting yet. I don't even know how long the
							buffer is.<br>
		  				<li>New Functions<br>
		  				<ul>
			  				<li>TimeShift - play/pause timeshifting.<br>
			  				<li>TimeShiftJump - jump forward or backward in timeshifting.<br>
			  				<li>ShowPids - shows the pids that are currently in use.<br>
			  				<li>ShowSignal - shows the signal strength and quality.<br>
			  				<li>ShowNAN - shows Now and Next information.<br>
			  			</ul>
		  				<li>If you attempt to run a second copy of DigitalWatch it will now put the
							existing window in focus instead of giving a error dialog.<br>
		  				<li>Fixed some memory leaks in the OSD as well as when building graphs.<br>
		  				<li>Adjusted some default Keys.ini mappings to accomodate TimeShifting and
							Now and Next buttons.<br>
					</ul>
					Notes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>I've only implemented basic timeshifting functionality because i'm not
							sure how well it will work. If it works ok for most people then i'll go
							ahead and add configuration options and implement a position slider
							for the OSD.<br>
						<li>With all the changes i made to the OSD i hope i didn't break anything.<br>
						<li>The signal quality and stength are only read when the ShowSignal() function
							is called. If you want to see if it's varying much then you'll need to keep
							pressing the button mapped to ShowSignal().<br>
		  				<li>Added GPL MPEG-1/2 Decoder to VideoDecoders.ini. It's an opensource
							mpeg2 video decoder. It doesn't have DxVA support, but from the little
							bit of testing i've done it's as good as the elecard decoder.<br>

				<h4><a name="DW051">DigitalWatch 0.51</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
		  				<li>Fixed bug where if a decoder entry was used in channels.ini then it wouldn't reset properly for the next channel.<br>
						<li>*.ini files now read from the DigitalWatch.exe directory.<br>
		    				No need to set the working directory in shortcuts anymore<br>
		  				<li>Added optional bandwidth parameter to channels.ini<br>
		    				See docs\Configuration.txt in the channels.ini for usage.<br>
		  				<li>Added color controls defaults to settings.ini.<br>
		    				This is for people with Matrox cards that need to have the default brightness set to 5000 instead of 750.<br>
						<li>Added AddToROT option to settings.ini so that it can be turned off.<br>
					</ul>

				<h4><a name="DW050">DigitalWatch 0.50</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Added Mpeg-2 Demultiplexer mode. (DVBInput=2 in settings.ini)<br>
							Channel changing is approx twice as fast.<br>
						<li>Changed channels.ini to allow an 'A' prefix to an audio pid.<br>
							The Mpeg-2 Demultiplexer can't detect if a pid is MPEG or AC3 so you'll need to prefix AC3 stream pid's with an A.<br>
						<li>Added more functions. See docs\functions.txt for usage details.<br>
						<ul>
							<li>AspectRatio()<br>
							<li>ZoomIn()<br>
							<li>ZoomOut()<br>
							<li>Mute()<br>
							<li>RecordingTimer()<br>
						</ul>
						<li>Fixed SetColorControls to work for channel changes.<br>
						<li>Fixed Ctrl-Alt-Del and Ctrl-Shift-Esc making modifiers stick.<br>
						<li>Might have fixed that blanking window problem. Not 100% sure.<br>
						<li>When you switch away from a program that had functions run for it, the previous settings return.<br>
						<li>Added an option to settings.ini to configure the OSD time display.<br>
						<li>Added a BasePriority option to settings.ini.<br>
						<li>Nine Melbourne pid's updated<br>
						<li>SBS frequency for Sydney corrected from 536500 to 571500<br>
					</ul>
				</div>

			<div id=text>
				<h4><a name="DW040">DigitalWatch 0.40</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Added configurable keys (keys.ini). See Functions.txt for details on the
							functions that can be assigned.<br>
						<li>Added assignment of Functions to individual channels.<br>
							This allows you to do all sorts of things. For example<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Select a different audio decoder for different channels.<br>
							<li>Adjust colour controls for each channel<br>
							<li>Adjust volume for each channel<br>
						</ul>
						<li>Created an installer.<br>
						<li>Fixed DisableScreenSaver. It works now.<br>
						<li>Fixed AR option in settings.ini to work properly.<br>
						<li>Reworked Zooming. 100% is now the default.<br>
						<li>Added ZoomMode option to settins.ini<br>
						<li>Added Colour Controls.<br>
						<li>Added Auto-Naming for recording file.<br>
						<li>Disabled channel changing while recording<br>
						<li>If re-selecting current channel then there are two options<br>
						<ul>
							<li>just show OSD rather than restarting channel.<br>
								use SetChannel(network) in keys.ini<br>
							<li>move to the next program in the network.<br>
								use SetChannel(network, -2) in keys.ini<br>
						</ul>
						<li>Added heaps of documentation.<br>
						<li>Added ability to send functions to DigitalWatch from other apps.<br>
							See WebShedulerModForDW02 DTVwrapper.cpp code for an example of how to
							do it.<br>
					</ul>

						<li>Channel changing now works for non cyberlink video decoders.<br>
						<li>Started WebSchedulerMod for DigitalWatch<br>

			<div id=text>
				<h4><a name="DW033">DigitalWatch 0.33</h4>
				<div id=indent>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Multiple card support (only for DVB-t)<br>
							In settings.ini choose the card you want to use.<br>
							Or use the command line argument [/card x] when running DigitalWatch.<br>
							card 1 is the first card, and would be the one WebScheduler will use.<br>
							I don't have two cards so this is all untested.<br>
						<li>Added version information to DigitalWatch.exe<br>
						<li>Added volume up and down. + and -keys on keyboard (not keypad)<br>
						<li>Added Filter properties key, F.<br>
						<li>Added resolutions.ini and key, B.<br>
						<li>Selectable font for each OSD item in osd.ini<br>
						<li>Included channels files for different regions.<br>
						<li>Changed the way the OSD gets erased.<br>
						<ul>
							<li>This change fixed OSD flickering when items were dissappearing when
								the overlay mixer was in use.<br>
							<li>It also introduced a "bug" that means that if the overlay mixer isn't
								being used then every time an OSD item hides the whole video window
								will go black and you need to grab it and move it with the mouse to
								make it come back.<br>
							<li>I don't think it's a huge issue though, because i can't imagine many
								people wont' be using the overlay mixer.<br>

				<div id=indent>
					Hasn't had a lot of testing yet.<br>
					Hasn't been tested with HD at all.<br>
					<br>
					Changes:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>fixed the channel up and down errors when looping.<br>
						<li>changed file parsing to allow more readable configuration files.
							To save a bit of confusion all .txt files are now .ini files.<br>
						<li>Added a settings.ini file for general options<br>
							CaptureName, CaptureFolder<br>
							AspectRatio<br>
							StartFullscreen, StoreFullscreenState<br>
							StartLastWindowPosition, StoreLastWindowPosition<br>
							LastWindowPositionX, LastWindowPositionY<br>
							LastWindowWidth, LastWindowHeight<br>
							StartLastChannel<br>
							LastNetwork, LastProgram<br>
							Zoom<br>
							DisableScreenSaver (untested)<br>
						<li>Added several other options. See settings.ini.<br>
						<li>Totally reworked the filter graph building for video and audio streams.<br>
							Filters should be cleaned up properly now.<br>
							VideoDecoders.ini and AudioDecoders.ini also allow much more detailed graph building.<br>
					</ul>
					<br>
					Known Bugs:
					<ul>
						<li>Draging the window when it's playing to another screen often causes playback to hang.<br>
						<li>Seems to be a memory leak when changing channels. Approx 1.2Mb each change.<br>
							I havn't looked into it yet, but it might be a directshow thing.<br>
						<li>Sometimes OSD items don't show up straight away. like when you're cycling
							through video decoders.<br>

					I'm providing this release for people to try if they want. It by no means
					complete, there's bound to still be bugs, and there's still stuff
					hardcoded that i want to make configurable in the end, but i figured i'd
					share what i've done already.<br>
		
					Known Issues / Bugs / Comments for v0.2a:
					<ul>
						<li>When clicking the window messages that are passed through from the video
							renderer aren't offset correctly. Means that when moving the window it will
							sometimes jump suddenly.<br>
						<li>If you have extra filters that have higher merit than the video renderer then
							they will get added, this is ok sometimes, but sometimes it will cause the
							program to crash. I'm implementing a more rigourous filter graph management
							system for the next version, much like zoomplayers filter files.<br>
						<li>If you drag the window from one screen to another while it's playing then
							playback will stall. You can however stop playback (0), move the window to the
							other screen and then restart by reselecting the channel you want to watch.<br>
						<li>The program isn't cleaning up Video Renderer's at the moment. I havn't tested
							it, but if you do a lot channel changing then you might run in to trouble after
							a while.<br>
		
						<li>The program is being added to the ROT so you use Filter Graph to see exactly
							what filters are being used. I left this in so that people having trouble can
							have a look and see what filters might be causing trouble.<br>
						<li>I've done very little testing with HD. I needed to set up the specific audio
							decoders in AudioDecoders.txt (the format is the same as in VideoDecoders.txt)
							to get AC3 working. You might get lucky though.<br>
