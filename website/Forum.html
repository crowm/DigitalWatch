				The <a href="http://forums.dvbowners.com/index.php">DVB-T Owners Discussion Forum</a>
				is where I first released DigitalWatch. There are lot of members there that now
				use DigitalWatch. If you are having trouble with any aspect of DigitalWatch then
				head over and check it out. You might find that other people have had similar
				trouble to you and someone else has provided an explanation or solution.
				I also check the forum most days so if noone else can help you then I should be
				able to help out. My member name is nate.<br>

				Thanks to Rob for providing such a great forum.<br>
