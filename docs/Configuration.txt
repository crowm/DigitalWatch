This file has not been updated for DW2 yet.

------------
channels.ini
------------
Channels in DigitalWatch are orgainised by network and program.
A network contains a group of programs whic are all on the same frequency.
Just list the Program definitions under each Network definition.
See the file in the channels folder for examples.

Format:

[Networks]
Network(frequency, bandwidth)
  Name(name)
...

[network frequency]
Program(name, program number)
# all these are optional
  VideoPid(vpid)
  AudioPid(apid, isAC3)(multiple if there is AC3 and mp2 audio for this 
program)
  LastSelectedAudioPid(apid)
  Teletext(datapid)
  FavoriteID(number)
  DisableAutoUpdate()
# end optional

Program(name, program number)
...

[network frequency]

--------
Keys.ini
--------
The keys.ini file associates keycodes with functions.
See the docs\Functions.txt file for details about the functions.

Format:

[menu]
  Key(keycode, shift, ctrl, alt) = function(params...)

    menu     - Only one group, [TV], is used at the moment.
               Once menu's are implemented then you will be able to a group
               for each menu.
    keycode  - The virtual key code number of the key to assign.
               if a key isn't assigned, and keycode is enabled in osd.ini then
               the keycode will be shown on the osd when the key is pressed.
               You can also specify a character inside single quotes eg. 'X'
               if it's a character from a to z then it should be a capital.
    shift    - 0 for shift not pressed
               1 for shift pressed
    ctrl     - 0 for ctrl not pressed
               1 for ctrl pressed
    alt      - 0 for alt not pressed
               1 for alt pressed
    function - any function listed in the docs\Functions.txt

  Mouse(event, shift, ctrl, alt) = function(params...)
  
    event - 2 for left double click
            3 for right click
            4 for middle click
            5 for mousewheel scroll up
            6 for mousewheel scroll down
    shift    - 0 for shift not pressed
               1 for shift pressed
    ctrl     - 0 for ctrl not pressed
               1 for ctrl pressed
    alt      - 0 for alt not pressed
               1 for alt pressed
    function - any function listed in the docs\Functions.txt

OSD.ini
-------

I have to rewrite this because the osd changed heaps in this release.
You should be able to pick up the general idea by going through the file.

------------
Settings.ini
------------

CardNumber - If you have multiple cards then you can choose to use the
             second or third card by putting a 2 or 3 here.
             DigitalWatch does not support using two card simultaneously yet.
             You can also specify the use of a different card by executing
             DigitalWatch.exe /card x
             Default: 1

DVBInput - Selects which input module to use for providing Video and Audio streams.
           1 - DVBSource -> TS Splitter
           2 - DVBSource -> Mpeg-2 Demultiplexer
           4 - DVBSource -> Mpeg-2 Demultiplexer -> TimeShifting
           When using 2 or 4 any AC3 pids in channels.ini need to be prefixed with an A.
           eg. Program_2("Nine Digital HD", 0, 512, A650, 0)
           Default: 2

CaptureFileName - The location and name of a recorded file.
    %Y - Year (4 digit)
    %y - Year (2 digit)
    %m - Month
    %d - Day
    %H - Hour (24 hour)
    %M - Minute
    %s - Second
    %h - Hour (12 hour)
    %A - AM/PM
    %a - a/p
    %W - Day of week (eg. Sunday, Monday, ...)
    %w - Short day of week (eg. Sun, Mon, ...)
    %X - Name of month (eg. January, February, ...)
    %x - Short name of month (eg. Jan, Feb, ...)

    %N - Current Network Name
    %P - Current Program Name
    %n - Current Network Number
    %p - Current Program Number

    %% - %

OSDTimeFormat - The format of the time displayed on the OSD.
                It uses the same tokens as CaptureFileName

TimeShiftFolder - The folder where timeshifting files will be stored

TimeShiftBufferMinutes - The number of minutes to buffer for timeshifting

AspectRatio - The AR setting isn't for the AR of your output device. It's the
              AR that the source video should be shown at.
              To work out the correct value for here first you need to work
              out if the pixel stretch ratio for your system.
                (stretch ratio) = (tv or monitor AR) / (video card AR)
                                = (16/9)             / (800/600)
                                = 1.33
              then to compensate you need to squash the source by the same
              factor.
                (DW AR setting) = (source AR. Always 16:9) / (stretch ratio)
                                = (16/9)                   / (1.33)
                                = 1.33
                                = 4/3
              Default: 16:9

Zoom - Percentage of window size to scale video.
       Default: 100

ZoomMode - if 0, then 100% zoom fits all the video in the window

                              state when DigitalWatch closes.

StoreAlwaysOnTopState - if 0, StartAlwaysOnTop is left alone.
                        if 1, StartAlwaysOnTop is update to match the
                              AlwaysOnTop state when DigitalWatch closes.

StoreLastWindowPosition - if 0, LastWindow* values are left alone.
                          if 1, LastWindow* values are updated when

VideoDecoders.ini & AudioDecoders.ini
-------------------------------------
See the default VideoDecoders.ini and AudioDecoders.ini for an examples

Format:
    [group header]
    eg. [filter group name]

    LoadFilter(CLSID, "unique name")
        - loads a directshow filter into the graph and give it a name.

    SourcePin("unique name", "Input Pin")
        - Use once to connect the video stream source to the
                     first filter you want to use.

    ConnectPins("unique name", "Output Pin", "next name", "Input Pin")
        - Connect the output of one filter to the input of the next

    RenderPin("next name", "Output Pin")
        - Renders an output pin of a filter. Not needed if
          you connect up all the filters with ConnectPin.

    RenderSourcePin()
        - Renders the source pin of the graph. Try using this
          if you have trouble with SourcePin, ConnectPins, and RenderPin.


If you want to figure out the these entries for yourself then
    - load up graphedt.exe (from DirectX SDK 9)
    - open up the "graph->insert filters" dialog
    - find and click on the filter you want to use
        (eg. Intervideo Audio Decoder)
    - in the Filter Moniker: box there should be something like
        @device:sw:{083863F1-70DE-11D0-BD40-00A0C911CE86}\{7E2E0DC1-31FD-11D2-9C21-00104B3801F6}
        the bit after the \ is the CLSID to use.

    - Now click insert filter then close the dialog.
    - The Input and Output pin names should be shown on the filter.
        Input pin: XForm In
        Output pin: XFrom Out

    Now with that information you'll be able to make an entry.

[Intervideo Audio Decoder]
LoadFilter ({7E2E0DC1-31FD-11D2-9C21-00104B3801F6}, "Intervideo Audio Decoder")
LoadFilter ({79376820-07D0-11CF-A24D-0020AFD79767}, "Default DirectSound Device")
SourcePin  ("Intervideo Audio Decoder", "XForm In")
ConnectPins("Intervideo Audio Decoder", "XFrom Out", "Default DirectSound Device", "Audio Input pin (rendered)")
