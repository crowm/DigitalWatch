  - Made ExecuteCommand operations able to read hex strings aswell as normal strings.
  - Fixed problem of Frequency list and Cards list duplicating if Watch TV is reselected
  - Fixed problem when scanning different frequencies with the same tsid

________

v2.0.0.9
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - Fixed channels file for when more than one broadcaster used the same transport stream id.
  - Fixed problem where selecting Watch TV a second time would duplicate all the channels.
  - Fixed problem in scanning. The waiting filters weren't cleared if there was a timeout scanning a table.
  - Fixed threading issue with data items and lists.
  - Fixed memory leak in OSD code

________

v2.0.0.7
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - Implemented Channel Scanning. This required heaps of other changes.
    - Renamed "Program" in DVBTChannels to "Service".
    - Added a command queue thread to TVControl to allow UpdateChannel events to be handled.
    - Reworked BDADVBTSource to be able to tune to frequencies without channels entries so that scanning can be done for that frequency.
  - Removed all state information (such as current network) from DVBTChannels. It's the wrong place for it.
  - Added menu options for adding and ordering networks.
  - Added FrequencyList to show a list of frequencies (for Australia) when adding networks.
  - Added ability for an OSDList to contain both items and itemLists.
  - Fixed DirectDraw OSD so the overlay color blt rectangle doesn't go out of bounds.
  - Commented out the FPS display.
  - Added DScaler video decoder
  - Fixed an exception when application is closing. There may still be a problem though.
  - Fixed stuttering by setting the reference clock to the DW demux instead of the default demux.

________

v2.0.0.5
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - Changed card detection so that newly added and removed cards get automatically actived and deactivated.
  - Changed DVB-T source rendering so that the pin types are done in order
    - teletext is only done if video renders ok.
    - ac3 is only rendered if mp2 doesn't render ok.
  - Added lots of decoders (thanks to bear for doing most of the work)
  - Fixed resolution problem is only the primary directdraw device is found.
  - Added code to switch OSD render method depending on the video renderer being used.
    This means that the VMR7 and VMR9 can now be used without flickering, but there's no OSD while using them.
  - Added extra logging for enumerations of directdraw devices and pin creation and rendering.

________

v2.0.0.3
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - More logging for DirectDraw enumeration to figure out why single monitor cards aren't working

________

________

  Changes
  ```````
