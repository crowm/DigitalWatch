________

v2.0.0.5
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - Changed card detection so that newly added and removed cards get automatically actived and deactivated.
  - Changed DVB-T source rendering so that the pin types are done in order
    - teletext is only done if video renders ok.
    - ac3 is only rendered if mp2 doesn't render ok.
  - Added lots of decoders (thanks to bear for doing most of the work)
  - Fixed resolution problem is only the primary directdraw device is found.
  - Added code to switch OSD render method depending on the video renderer being used.
    This means that the VMR7 and VMR9 can now be used without flickering, but there's no OSD while using them.
  - Added extra logging for enumerations of directdraw devices and pin creation and rendering.
