________

v0.7.0.1
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - Fixed default ControlBar.ini to have ShowNowAndNext instead of ShowNaN
  - Fixed broken functions in channels.ini
  - Fixed NaNTime[n], NaNLength[n], and NaNDescription[n] for OSD.ini
  - Added value parsing to DrawBitmap string.
      eg. DrawBitmap("images\network$(NetworkNumber).bmp", ...)

________

v0.7.0.0
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - Fixed disabled SetColorControls
  - Fixed GDI leak in EraseBackground
  - Fixed OSD.ini to read from, and Settings.ini to write to, the app folder.
  - Fixed ScanChannels.exe to start with Network_1 instead of Network_0
  - Fixed "could not set IVideoWindow visible" when not using overlay mixer.
  - Fixed crash when using VMR9. It works, but there's really bad OSD flicker.
  - Fixed crash when using FFDShow and changing channels.
  - Fixed timeshifting files not getting deleted on program exit.
  - Totally reworked the OSD for better skinning support.
    - All commands now trigger osd events which can be configured to show any
	  of the available information.
    - OSD text background can be transparent when not using the overlay mixer.
    - Added bitmap support.
    - Impoved on problem of OSD blanking out when any entry disapears.
	  It still happens occasionally but i think it's better than it was.
	- Custom OSD events can be defined. Then assign the event to a key or
	  button by using the event name instead of a predefined function.
	  ShowTime, ShowChannelInfo (used to be ShowPids), ShowSignal, and
	  ShowNowAndNext are no longer predefined functions. They are now events,
	  so take a look at them for an example of what you can do.
  - Added a control bar similar to zoomplayer's for easier mouse control.
    See ControlBar.ini to configure or skin it.
      Thanks to Builty for kicking this one off, and for the artwork.
  - Added config options for mouse buttons and scroll wheel in keys.ini.
      Thanks to Builty for this one.
  - Added options for timeshifting location and duration to settings.ini.
      Thanks to Joey for posting the code to do this.
  - Added creation of the timeshifting profile file to the timeshift folder.
    If you load this file with the StreamBufferSource from another computer you
    should be able to watch whatever is in the buffer. Untested.

  Notes
  `````
  - I havn't done a lot of testing with all the changes i made to the way the
    OSD works so I wouldn't be surprised if there's a few bugs. Hopefully none
	are too serious.
  - I've temporarily disabled the code that get's the signal quality and
    strength because it was causing some strange behaviour.
________

v0.6.0.1
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - Fixed timeshifting requiring D drive bug.
  - Added warning if no entries in channels.ini
  - Fixed some of the project settings in the source.
________

v0.6.0.0
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - DigitalWatch is now open source.
  - Fixed current decoder text in OSD not updating on channel change.
  - Now and Next Information Added (thanks RAvenGEr).
    Requires a valid program number in channels.ini entries.
  - ScanChannels.exe
      Rather than trying to keep up-to-date channels.ini files for each city,
      especially now that program numbers have to be valid, you can use this
      command-line application to generate channel.ini entries.
  - Revamped OSD.
    Shouldn't look any different to the end user, but the back end has been
    overhauled to provide support for multi-line entries. If OSD.ini entries
    have the maxWidth set to anything greater than 0 then text will wrap to the
    next line if it reaches that width.
    I did my best to eliminate flicker, but there's sometimes a slight flick
    everytime an entry changes.
  - Signal Strength and Quality (thanks RAvenGEr)
  - DVBInput mode 4 - Same as 2 but with timeshifting.
    It's using the Microsoft Stream Buffer Sink and Stream Buffer Source
    filters. According to the documentation these only work in windows XP.
    No configuration for timeshifting yet. I don't even know how long the
    buffer is.
  - New Functions
    - TimeShift - play/pause timeshifting.
    - TimeShiftJump - jump forward or backward in timeshifting.
    - ShowPids - shows the pids that are currently in use.
    - ShowSignal - shows the signal strength and quality.
    - ShowNAN - shows Now and Next information.
  - If you attempt to run a second copy of DigitalWatch it will now put the
    existing window in focus instead of giving a error dialog.
  - Fixed some memory leaks in the OSD as well as when building graphs.
  - Adjusted some default Keys.ini mappings to accomodate TimeShifting and
    Now and Next buttons.

  Notes
  `````
  - I've only implemented basic timeshifting functionality because i'm not
    sure how well it will work. If it works ok for most people then i'll go
    ahead and add configuration options and implement a position slider
    for the OSD.
  - With all the changes i made to the OSD i hope i didn't break anything.
  - The signal quality and stength are only read when the ShowSignal() function
    is called. If you want to see if it's varying much then you'll need to keep
    pressing the button mapped to ShowSignal().
  - Added GPL MPEG-1/2 Decoder to VideoDecoders.ini. It's an opensource
    mpeg2 video decoder. It doesn't have DxVA support, but from the little
    bit of testing i've done it's as good as the elecard decoder.

________

v0.5.1.0
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - Fixed bug where if a decoder entry was used in channels.ini then it
    wouldn't reset properly for the next channel.
  - *.ini files now read from the DigitalWatch.exe directory.
    No need to set the working directory in shortcuts anymore
  - Added optional bandwidth parameter to channels.ini
    See docs\Configuration.txt in the channels.ini for usage.
  - Added color controls defaults to settings.ini.
    This is for people with Matrox cards that need to have the default
    brightness set to 5000 instead of 750.
  - Added AddToROT option to settings.ini so that it can be turned off.

________

v0.5.0.0
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - Added Mpeg-2 Demultiplexer mode. (DVBInput=2 in settings.ini)
    Channel changing is approx twice as fast.
  - Changed channels.ini to allow an 'A' prefix to an audio pid.
    The Mpeg-2 Demultiplexer can't detect if a pid is MPEG or AC3 so
    you'll need to prefix AC3 stream pid's with an A.
  - Added more functions. See docs\functions.txt for usage details.
    - AspectRatio()
    - ZoomIn()
    - ZoomOut()
    - Mute()
    - RecordingTimer()
  - Fixed SetColorControls to work for channel changes.
  - Fixed Ctrl-Alt-Del and Ctrl-Shift-Esc making modifiers stick.
  - Might have fixed that blanking window problem. Not 100% sure.
  - When you switch away from a program that had Functions run for it the
    previous settings return.
  - Added an option to settings.ini to configure the OSD time display.
  - Added a BasePriority option to settings.ini.
  - Nine Melbourne pid's updated
  - SBS frequency for Sydney corrected from 536500 to 571500

________

v0.4.0.0
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - Added configurable keys (keys.ini). See Functions.txt for details on the
    functions that can be assigned.
  - Added assignment of Functions to individual channels.
    This allows you to do all sorts of things. For example
    - Select a different audio decoder for different channels.
    - Adjust colour controls for each channel
    - Adjust volume for each channel
  - Created an installer.
  - Fixed DisableScreenSaver. It works now.
  - Fixed AR option in settings.ini to work properly.
  - Reworked Zooming. 100% is now the default.
  - Added ZoomMode option to settins.ini
  - Added Colour Controls.
  - Added Auto-Naming for recording file.
  - Disabled channel changing while recording
  - If re-selecting current channel then there are two options
    - just show OSD rather than restarting channel.
        use SetChannel(network) in keys.ini
    - move to the next program in the network.
        use SetChannel(network, -2) in keys.ini
  - Added heaps of documentation.
  - Added ability to send functions to DigitalWatch from other apps.
    See WebShedulerModForDW02 DTVwrapper.cpp code for an example of how to
    do it.

________

v0.3.3.2
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - Added Autohide for mouse. hides after 3 seconds if in fullscreen.
  - Channel changing now works for non cyberlink video decoders.
  - Started a WebSchedulerMod for DigitalWatch
    see http://robdvd.radfiles.net/viewtopic.php?t=587
  - Added Overlay Mixer2 support to the OSD
  - Added transparent OSD background if using an Overlay Mixer.

________

v0.3.3.1
________

  Changes
  ```````
  - Added more error checking when graph building
  - Fixed the bug i introduced in 0.33 when not using the overlay mixer.

_____

v0.3.3.0
_____

  Changes
  ```````
  - Multiple card support (only for DVB-t)
      In settings.ini choose the card you want to use.
      Or use the command line argument [/card x] when running DigitalWatch.
      card 1 is the first card, and would be the one WebScheduler will use.
      I don't have two cards so this is all untested.
  - Added version information to DigitalWatch.exe
  - Added volume up and down. + and - keys on keyboard (not keypad)
  - Added Filter properties key, F.
  - Added resolutions.ini and key, B.
  - Selectable font for each OSD item in osd.ini
  - Included channels files for different regions.
  - Changed the way the OSD gets erased.
    - This change fixed OSD flickering when items were dissappearing when
      the overlay mixer was in use.
    - It also introduced a "bug" that means that if the overlay mixer isn't
      being used then every time an OSD item hides the whole video window
      will go black and you need to grab it and move it with the mouse to
      make it come back.
    - I don't think it's a huge issue though, because i can't imagine many
      people wont' be using the overlay mixer

v0.3.2.0
_____

  Changes
  ```````
- Probable fix for non cyberlink channel changing bug. (i can't test this)
- Checks that Network is set in channels.ini attempting to lock channel.
- Fixed OSD causing a crash after running for a long time. (not tested)
- Added Last Channel key, N.
- Added Always On Top Key, L. With this on error dialogs come up behind
   the video window. I'm not fixing it because soon i'll make the errors
   show on the OSD instead.

v0.3.0.0 beta
_____________

  Hasn't had a lot of testing yet.
  Hasn't been tested with HD at all.

  Changes
  ```````
- fixed the channel up and down errors when looping.
- changed file parsing to allow more readable configuration files.
  To save a bit of confusion all .txt files are now .ini files.
- Added a settings.ini file for general options
    CaptureName, CaptureFolder
    AspectRatio
    StartFullscreen, StoreFullscreenState
    StartLastWindowPosition, StoreLastWindowPosition
    LastWindowPositionX, LastWindowPositionY

    LastNetwork, LastProgram
    Zoom
    DisableScreenSaver (untested)
- Added several other options. See settings.ini.
- Totally reworked the filter graph building for video and audio streams.
  Filters should be cleaned up properly now.
  VideoDecoders.ini and AudioDecoders.ini also allow much more detailed graph
  building.

  Known Bugs
  ``````````
- Draging the window when it's playing to another screen often causes playback
  to hang.
- Seems to be a memory leak when changing channels. Approx 1.2Mb each change.
  I havn't looked into it yet, but it might be a directshow thing.
- Sometimes OSD items don't show up straight away. like when you're cycling
  through video decoders.

_____

v0.2a
_____

  I'm providing this release for people to try if they want. It by no means
  complete, there's bound to still be bugs, and there's still stuff
  hardcoded that i want to make configurable in the end, but i figured i'd
  share what i've done already.

  Known Issues / Bugs / Comments for v0.2a
  ````````````````````````````````````````
- When clicking the window messages that are passed through from the video
  renderer aren't offset correctly. Means that when moving the window it will
  sometimes jump suddenly.
- If you have extra filters that have higher merit than the video renderer then
  they will get added, this is ok sometimes, but sometimes it will cause the
  program to crash. I'm implementing a more rigourous filter graph management
  system for the next version, much like zoomplayers filter files.
- If you drag the window from one screen to another while it's playing then
  playback will stall. You can however stop playback (0), move the window to the
  other screen and then restart by reselecting the channel you want to watch.
- The program isn't cleaning up Video Renderer's at the moment. I havn't tested
  it, but if you do a lot channel changing then you might run in to trouble after
  a while.

- The program is being added to the ROT so you use Filter Graph to see exactly
  what filters are being used. I left this in so that people having trouble can
  have a look and see what filters might be causing trouble.
- I've done very little testing with HD. I needed to set up the specific audio
  decoders in AudioDecoders.txt (the format is the same as in VideoDecoders.txt)
  to get AC3 working. You might get lucky though.
